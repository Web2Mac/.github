## üöÄ Overview

**Web2Mac** is a lightweight macOS utility that allows you to turn any website into its own standalone application. Instead of juggling dozens of browser tabs, you can create apps that live in your Dock and Launchpad, giving your favorite sites the same presence as native apps.  

You choose the website, set a name, pick or upload an icon, adjust how the app should open (window size, chrome on/off), and Web2Mac instantly builds it. These apps run in isolated shells, keeping them separate from your regular browser workflow.  

The benefit is focus: dashboards, chat tools, productivity platforms, and entertainment sites become one-click apps. They open quickly, look cleaner, and reduce tab clutter. For people who live in web services but want a more organized desktop, Web2Mac delivers the perfect balance between the web and macOS.
